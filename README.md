# Feature Engineering Project

• Collaborated with a Data Science team at undisclosed US auto-parts firm to investigate feature engineering approaches that might improve their forecasts for sparse demand products.

• Developed a python workflow that allowed us to perform thousands of feature engineering experiments.

• Project outcomes led to decrease in model training run time by 20% and provided a feature engineering strategy that identified which approaches worked best for various machine learning algorithms

• Work was accepted for presentation at the 2021 INFORMS Business Analytics Conference and paper was published in the Proceedings of the Midwest Decision Sciences Institute Conference"
